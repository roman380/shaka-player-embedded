/**
 * This wraps the normal HeapTracer in an interface that can be used by V8
 * to track objects.  Methods defined here will be called by V8 when it decides
 * that a GC needs to be run.
 *
 * This explains how the V8 GC works and how we interact with it:
 *
 * There are two kinds of objects that are managed by different GCs, a
 * JavaScript object (v8::Value) which is handled by the V8 gc, and
 * BackingObject's which are handled by ObjectTracker.  When the V8 GC runs, we
 * need to tell it what objects we hold so it knows the V8 objects to delete.
 * That is the purpose of this class.
 *
 * When a V8 pass start, V8 will call TracePrologue.  Then it will traverse
 * its objects, marking alive objects.  Any object that looks like a wrapper
 * will be added to a list.  Once the traversal is done, it will call
 * RegisterV8References passing in the list.  Then it will call AdvanceTracing
 * to allow us to traverse our heap.  We should traverse our alive objects
 * and any wrapper objects given to us.  We should then (a) mark these object
 * as alive so we don't free them, and (b) tell V8 about any objects we hold.
 *
 * When we tell V8 about alive objects, it may need to do some more traversals,
 * which may in turn find more wrappers.  If this happens, it will call
 * RegisterV8References and AdvanceTracing again.
 *
 * At points between method calls, it is possible for JavaScript to run.
 * Because this runs on the event thread, it is not possible for JavaScript to
 * run while one of these methods are being called, but between it is possible.
 * V8 monitors all the objects and will ensure that any new objects will be
 * given to us.
 *
 * After V8 has traced every object TraceEpilogue is called.  We use this to
 * free any object that is not marked as alive.
